# YouTube Player Application using Kotlin

 ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/840/1*oyjW0tejW_oiznAo4hNThA.png)<br><br>


* In this project we will learn how to integrate and play a video using YouTube API in Android with Kotlin.<br>

* The YouTube Android Player API enables you to incorporate video playback functionality into your Android applications. <br>
* The API defines methods for loading and playing YouTube videos (and playlists) and for customizing and controlling the video playback experience.<br>
* Using the API, you can load or cue videos into a player view embedded in your application’s UI. You can then control playback programmatically. For example, you can play, pause, or seek to a specific point in the currently loaded video.<br>
* You can also register event listeners to get callbacks for certain events, such as the player loading a video or the player state changing. Finally, the API has helper functionality to support orientation changes as well as transitions to fullscreen playback.<br>
